# NIRScanNano Case

We have designed a small 3D-printable case for the DLP NIRScan Nano EVM that can be attached to the wall mount of the [OneNineDesign](https://www.oneninedesign.co.uk/) case for the official [Raspberry Pi 3 touchscreen](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/).
