    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify and characterize drug compounds. As a non-destructive and non-invasive method, NIR spectroscopy can quickly and accurately provide information about the chemical composition of a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sample preparation and measurement of NIR spectra for pharmaceutical analysis\n",
    " - Understanding the capabilities and limitations of NIR spectroscopy\n",
    " - Physical influences on the measurement of spectra\n",
    " - Types and applications of preprocessing methods\n",
    " - Basic understanding of data exploration workflows\n",
    " \n",
    "## Laboratory Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab experiment, you will measure the spectra of all samples provided.  The sample preparation is a critical step here and must be performed carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hazards\n",
    "\n",
    " - No special hazard precautions other than standard laboratory requirements need to be taken.\n",
    " - Do not look directly into the lamp of the spectrometer.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Materials\n",
    "\n",
    " - Substances are provided by the course instructor\n",
    " - Glass vials for NIR measurements\n",
    " - DLP® NIRScan™ Nano EVM with a control device or computer\n",
    " \n",
    "### Experimental Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "All steps will be discussed with the instructor prior to the experiment. The instructor will then give you a brief introduction to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Carefully transfer the respective sample into the glass vial using a spatula.\n",
    " - A minimum filling height of about 1 cm should be achieved.\n",
    " - Shake the glass vial carefully and gently before measurement.\n",
    " - Measure your sample with the spectrometer.\n",
    " \n",
    "Repeat this process for all sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the Python NIRScanNano library to your folder or use a local installation."
